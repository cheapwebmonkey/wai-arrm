## What is ARRM

Accessibility Roles and Responsibilities Mapping (ARRM) helps define which roles (designer, developer, writer, etc.) have which responsibilities for meeting which aspects of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) requirements.

Here’s a simplified example. For meeting the WCAG requirement on headings:
* Writers are responsible for the writing the heading text
* Designers are responsible for defining how the headings look
* Developers are responsible for coding or marking up the headings

ARRM assigns primary, secondary, and contributor level responsibilities for tasks.

ARRM provides an example of typical roles and mapping. It is also a tool for project managers to assign different responsibilities across roles within their team.

## Typical Roles and Mapping

ARRM provides one approach for defining roles and responsibilities.

You can use these as they are, without doing any more work to customize them.

## Customizing ARRM for Your Situation

ARRM also guides organizations that want to customize their own accessibility roles and responsibilities mapping, based on the roles and considerations in their organizations.
* **[Customizing ARRM for Your Situation](https://www@@)** explains how to use the Role Definitions and the Decision Tree to create your customized Accessibility Responsibilities Mapping.
* **[ARRM Decision Tree](https://www@@)** provides the steps for deciding which roles have which level responsibilities for accessibility tasks.
